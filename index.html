            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>My interest in ITEC 23 - Social and Professional Issues in Information Technology stems from its exploration of critical topics such as Cyber Security, Cyber Ethical Principles, Cyber Crime Law, Freedom of Expression, and Technologies Impact on Privacy. These areas are vital as they address the ethical and legal challenges in the rapidly evolving digital landscape. Cyber Security fascinates me because it protects sensitive data from breaches, like the PhilHealth Medusa Attack in 2023, ensuring trust in digital systems. Understanding Cyber Crime Law and Freedom of Expression is crucial for balancing individual rights with societal responsibilities, especially in cases like cyber libel, which can harm reputations online.</p>
            <p>The impact of technology on privacy is particularly compelling, as incidents like the COMELEC Data Breach of 2016 highlight the vulnerability of personal information. These topics are important to me because they shape how IT professionals can create secure, ethical, and fair digital environments. As an aspiring IT professional, I aim to apply these principles to safeguard data and promote responsible technology use.</p>

            <h2>Objectives</h2>
            <p>This portfolio aims to showcase my understanding of social and professional issues in IT, focusing on cyber security, ethics, and privacy, while demonstrating my ability to analyze real-world incidents and propose ethical solutions.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>ITEC 23 has deepened my understanding of ethical dilemmas in IT through real-world cases like the COMELEC Data Breach of 2016, which exposed 70 million voters' data due to inadequate cybersecurity. This incident highlighted the ethical responsibility to protect personal information and the consequences of negligence. Similarly, studying Cyber Libel taught me the importance of balancing freedom of expression with preventing harm, as malicious online statements can damage reputations and violate laws like RA 10175.</p>
            <p>These lessons have shaped my approach to ethical decision-making by emphasizing integrity, accountability, and respect for privacy. In my future career, I plan to uphold these principles by implementing robust security measures, ensuring compliance with the Data Privacy Act (RA 10173), and advocating for transparent data practices. My goal is to contribute to a trustworthy digital ecosystem that prioritizes user safety and ethical technology use.</p>

                        <h3>4.1 Summary of the Incident</h3>
                        <p>In 2023, the PhilHealth Medusa Attack saw hackers from the Medusa ransomware group breach the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation’s systems, stealing sensitive personal information, including confidential memos and member data. The hackers demanded a P17 million ransom, which the government refused, prompting calls for enhanced cybersecurity measures across public and private sectors to prevent similar breaches.</p>

                        <h3>4.2 Ethical Issues Involved</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Negligence in Data Protection:</strong> PhilHealth failed to maintain basic cybersecurity (e.g., expired antivirus), violating their duty of care to safeguard sensitive data. <em>Why it matters: Inadequate security measures expose sensitive data to risks, undermining public trust.</em></li>
                            <li><strong>Violation of Privacy Rights:</strong> The breach compromised personal and health-related information, infringing on individuals' right to privacy under the Data Privacy Act (RA 10173). <em>Why it matters: Privacy is a fundamental right, and its violation erodes personal security.</em></li>
                            <li><strong>Lack of Transparency:</strong> Delayed and limited disclosure of the breach showed a lack of accountability and openness, leaving the public uninformed. <em>Why it matters: Transparency is essential for maintaining public trust and accountability.</em></li>
                            <li><strong>Public Sector Responsibility:</strong> As a government agency, PhilHealth’s failure reflects poor stewardship of public trust and taxpayer-funded resources. <em>Why it matters: Public institutions must uphold higher standards of responsibility.</em></li>
                            <li><strong>Harm to Vulnerable Populations:</strong> The leak disproportionately affected vulnerable citizens who may lack the means to protect themselves from fraud or identity theft. <em>Why it matters: Ethical systems must prioritize protecting the most vulnerable.</em></li>
                            <li><strong>Malicious Intent of Hackers:</strong> The Medusa ransomware group acted unethically by exploiting data for profit, violating the principle of non-maleficence (do no harm). <em>Why it matters: Exploitative actions undermine ethical principles and societal trust.</em></li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="carousel-slide">
                        <h3>4.3 Application of Ethical Theories</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Deontology:</strong> PhilHealth had a duty under RA 10173 to secure data, and their failure to do so breached this obligation, causing harm.</li>
                            <li><strong>Virtue Ethics:</strong> The lack of diligence and responsibility in maintaining cybersecurity reflects a failure in organizational virtues.</li>
                            <li><strong>Utilitarianism:</strong> The breach caused widespread harm to millions, outweighing any cost savings from inadequate security, making it unethical.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>4.4 Proposed Ethical Solutions and Interventions</h3>
                        <p>Organizations should conduct regular security audits, implement end-to-end encryption, and train staff on cybersecurity protocols. Compliance with RA 10173, including appointing a Data Protection Officer, is critical. Public awareness campaigns can educate users on phishing risks, reducing vulnerabilities to similar attacks.</p>
